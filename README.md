# ParseReceiveAndShow
Use of Parse Sdk for push notifications and displaying the complete push notification in a separate screen(activity).

Examples for push notifications on google are hard to implement. Parse push notifications are easy to use.
How ever, most of the tutorials do not show the notification recieving part. I have Implemented that.

P.S. Get a parse account and use your keys in keys.java
